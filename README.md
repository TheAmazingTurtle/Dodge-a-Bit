# Dodge-a-bit!
Dodge-a-Bit is a 2D logic-based arcade game that integrates concepts from the binary system and bitwise operations into fast-paced gameplay. The player must survive a falling 8-bit block by interpreting bitwise operations within a time limit. As the game progresses, the allotted time delay gradually decreases and binary operators appear more quickly, while the player has only three lives. To survive, the player must move left and right and dash across the screen to dodge bits with resulting value of 1 and find bits containing 0, which serve as safe zones.
